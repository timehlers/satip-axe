![Build firmware](https://github.com/Jalle19/satip-axe/workflows/Build%20firmware/badge.svg)

A maintained fork of [perexg/satip-axe](https://github.com/perexg/satip-axe), a firmware with minisatip for Inverto IDL-400s/Grundig GSS.BOX/Telestar Digibit R1

## Releases

Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Jalle19/satip-axe/releases).

## Improvements in this fork

* Uses upstream minisatip without any custom patches
* DVB-CSA support in minisatip (due to CPU limitations only 1-2 streams can be decoded simultaneously)
* Uses newer version of OScam
* Reworked build system for easier development
* Leaner firmware image (obsolete versions of minisatip, tvheadend and Python have been removed)
* SFTP support for easier file configuration editing
* Removed telnet and FTP support for better security

## Build instructions

The build system used in this repository uses Docker. To build a new release, simply run:

```bash
make docker-clean-release
```

The release build will be in the `out/` directory.

## Flashing new firmware

There are two ways to flash new firmware to your device:

* using a USB stick (as explained in [upstream's dist/README](https://github.com/perexg/satip-axe/blob/master/dist/README))
* using the `upgrade-fw` script. Download the `.fw` file you want to flash to your device, then run `upgrade-fw path/to/file.fw`. The script only works for updating installations made to the device's flash memory - if dual-booting from a 
USB device you should not use it.

### Updating from older upstream builds (16 and older)

If your configuration for minisatip is done with the `MINISATIP8` and `MINISATIP8_OPTS` options you need to change 
those configuration keys to be `MINISATIP` and `MINISATIP_OPTS` respectively, otherwise `minisatip` won't start 
at all.

It's best to start with a [fresh configuration](./fs-add/etc/config.default), then adjust `MINISATIP_OPTS` according to your setup.


## Securing your installation

By default, the `root` password is `satip`. To harden the installation you should 
disable the password and use SSH keys to access the device.

1. Create the file `/etc/sysconfig/authorized_keys` containing your SSH public key
2. Reboot the device and verify that you can SSH into it without entering a password
3. Copy `/etc/passwd` to `/etc/sysconfig/passwd` and modify the password entry for `root` to be `*`. This disables the password completely.
4. Reboot once more. Now your device can only be accessed using SSH keys.

## Using the HTTP server

To serve static files over HTTP, please:

1. Set `INETD=yes` in `/etc/sysconfig/config`
2. Create `/mnt/data/html` and put your files there

## A note on the Docker image

The original build system for this firmware is based on a very old version of 
CentOS 7 for STLinux. The original ISO and yum mirror is long gone, and the 
Docker image `jalle19/centos7-stlinux24` pushed to Docker Hub is the only 
remaining copy that has the relevant toolchain available.

Since CentOS 7 has been EOL for something like 10 years now, most mirrors are 
gone. CERN still maintains a mirror, which we use to install some additional 
packages required for building the firmware that are not present in the base 
`jalle19/centos7-stlinux24` image.

Lately the mirror CERN has been hosting has started acting up, possibly it's 
being retired. I have pushed a `jalle19/satip-axe-make` image based on the 
Dockerfile in this repository, so the firmware can be built without any yum/dnf 
install operations.
